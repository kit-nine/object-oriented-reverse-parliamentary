# â†’ - I think to rework the compass and to add the graphical representation, I need to restart in a new file. This is that reworking.

#   - two executives
#   - a set amount of laws per year - manual input or a set amount can be built in
#   - go through entire legislative process rather than just simple voting
#   - full political compass; left-right and libertarian-authoritarian (array)
#   - get rid of most global variables
#   - object-oriented legislature
#   - the parents will survive 1 year
#   - media influence can skew the voting by a certain amount - manual input
#   - law creation is skewed toward the position of the legislative, not just random from their side
#   - reproduction is yearly, for simplicity of elections
#   - cool & easy to use graphics that show all the possible information you can take from the simulation
#   - passed laws' average position
#   - make some voters not vote
#   - electoral system
